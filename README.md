2.  **Clone the repo.**

   `https://github.com/Danishkhurshid/gatsby-commerce-site.git`

3. **Run Npm install**

     Run npm install to install all the dependencies. 

4.  **Add url to your .env.development file**

    Add your drupal base url to development file.
    ```GATSBY_DRUPAL_ROOT= Here goes your url``` 

5.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd your-cloned-repo/
    gatsby develop
    ```

6.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the cloned directory in your code editor of choice and edit. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
